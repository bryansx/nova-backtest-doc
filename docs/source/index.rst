Welcome to NovaLabs backtest documentation!
===================================

**NovaLabs backtest** is a Python library for backtesting algorithmic trading 
strategies. It aims to facilitate the development of algorithmic trading on the
**crypto market** by downloading historical data prices on the biggest centralized
exchanges (Binance, Bybit, OKX, KuCoin & more) and simulate the trades of
a given strategy throughout past years. It returns a bunch of statistics, giving a
strong evaluation of your strategies performances.
